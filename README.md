# React-Devcamp 

following along with the Devcamp reat tutorial using my own from-scratch application setup based on https://github.com/dallinmoak/webpack-basics. 

`npm i` to install node dependencies

`npm run dev` to serve the app on local host port 3000 in dev mode

`npm run build` for production build
